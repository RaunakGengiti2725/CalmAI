# MindBloom

MindBloom is a calm, empathetic web app for teenagers to explore emotions through
interactive storytelling and journaling. It visualizes growth as a friendly tree
that responds to your reflections.

## Setup

```bash
cd mindbloom
npm install
npm run dev
```

Create a `.env` file in `mindbloom` with your OpenAI API key:

```
VITE_OPENAI_API_KEY=YOUR_KEY_HERE
```

The app is built with React, React Router, Tailwind CSS, and the OpenAI API. It
can be deployed to any static host such as Vercel or Netlify.
